# Subruster
Fast, compact and all-around subdomain enumeration tool written in Rust, which uses dns bruteforce, internet search and recursive http content search.
    
    DNS BRUTEFORCE MODULE:
    Takes a wordlist of subdomains and perform a dns query using threads.
    
    INTERNET SEARCH MODULE:
    Searches subdomains in dns.bufferover, crt.sh, dnsrepo (more to come.)
    
    RECURSIVE HTTP CONTENT SEARCH MODULE:
    Tries to connect to http and https ports of the domains and searches for subdomains inside the response html, executes recursively if any new subdomain is found during the process.
